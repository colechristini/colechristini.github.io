# on[...]
Mostly a place for me (Cole Christini) to jot down my thoughts on various topics and document things I work on. Primarily writing about CS (especially algorithms & ML), but also covering history, literature, classics, etc. Basically whatever I'm reading/interested in at the moment. Inspired by (or perhaps aspirng to be like) [Yuxi on the Wired](https://yuxi.ml/), as well as the Thinking Machines blog.
