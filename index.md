This blog is mostly a place for me to jot

Inspired by (or perhaps aspirng to be like) [Yuxi on the Wired](https://yuxi.ml/), as well as the Thinking Machines blog. Named after the Pocket Perspectives series from Thames & Hudson.

If (for some odd reason) you want to know more about me, see the [readme](colechristini.github.io/readme).
