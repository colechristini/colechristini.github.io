# on[...]
Mostly a place for me to jot down my thoughts on various topics and document things I work on. I spend a lot of my time thinking about is CS, ML, and math so some of what I write will be too. Also my collected thoughts on various books, and maybe some things I've learned (outside CS) that might someday be useful to some other people.

Inspired by (or perhaps aspirng to be like) [Yuxi on the Wired](https://yuxi.ml/), as well as the Thinking Machines blog. Named after the Pocket Perspectives series from Thames & Hudson.
