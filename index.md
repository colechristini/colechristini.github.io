Currently a senior studying Computer Science & History at Carnegie Mellon. My interests are in parallel algorithms, ML (systems), and drug discovery. I enjoy thinking about algorithmic challenges and how to write fast & elegant code. 

I also like to read (sci-fi and nonfiction), explore new places, eat good food, play soccer (not horribly) and tennis (horribly).

This site is mostly for me to document my thoughts on things I read/see as well as projects I work on. Inspired (both structurally and in the things I aspire to write) by [Yuxi on the Wired](https://yuxi.ml/). 

## things i'm doing:
- will be joining SHV as a Codepoint fellow.
- currently head TA of 15-210 at CMU (fall '24-present).{% sidenote 'reflections-on-teaching' 'Reflections on Teaching.' %}

## things i've done:
### at cmu:
- did research in Jia Zhihao's group at CMU on the Mirage compiler.


### elsewhere & before:
- spent summer '25 at D.E. Shaw Research working on algorithms for searching trillion-scale chemical libraries.
- spent summers '23, '24 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute working on episodic mutagenesis.
- read the odyssey in ancient greek.
