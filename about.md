Currently a senior studying Computer Science & History at Carnegie Mellon. My interests are in parallel algorithms, ML (systems), and drug discovery. I enjoy thinking about algorithmic challenges and how to write fast & elegant code. 

I also like to read (sci-fi and nonfiction), explore new places, eat good food, and play soccer (not horribly) and tennis (horribly).

## things i'm doing:
- will be joining SHV as a Codepoint fellow. Planning to work on ML research at various startups.
- currently head TA of 15-210 at CMU (fall '24-present).

### at cmu & elsewhere:
- spent summer '25 at D.E. Shaw Research working on algorithms for searching trillion-scale chemical libraries.
- did research in Jia Zhihao's group at CMU on the Mirage compiler.
- spent summers '23, '24 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute working on episodic mutagenesis.

###  before:
- read the odyssey in ancient greek.
