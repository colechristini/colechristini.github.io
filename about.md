Currently a senior studying Computer Science & History at Carnegie Mellon. My interests are in parallel algorithms, ML (systems), and drug discovery. I enjoy thinking about how to solve hard problems with both classical and ML methods.

Outside of directly work-relevant interests, I love to read, especially sci-fi, history, and essays on various topics. I also enjoy exploring new places and traveling, eating (and cooking) good food, and playing soccer and tennis. 

## things i'm doing:
- will be joining SHV as a Codepoint fellow. Planning to work on ML research at various startups.
- currently head TA of 15-210 at CMU (fall '24-present).

### at cmu & elsewhere:
- spent summer '25 at D.E. Shaw Research working on algorithms for searching trillion-scale chemical libraries.
- did research in Jia Zhihao's group at CMU on the Mirage compiler.
- spent summers '23, '24 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute working on episodic mutagenesis.

###  before:
