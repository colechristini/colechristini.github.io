I'm a senior studying Computer Science & History at Carnegie Mellon. My interests are in parallel algorithms, ML (systems), and drug discovery. I enjoy thinking about how to solve hard problems with both classical and ML methods.  

## research interests
I'm currently interested in diffusion models, including improvements in few-/single-step methods, methods for representation learning/alignment, and general methods for improving performance. I'm also interested in improvements and systems surrounding LoRA, including batch fine-tuning and dynamic-rank methods. I find problems in ML systems and parallel algorithms interesting as well.


## things i'm doing:
- currently head TA of 15-210 at CMU (fall '24-present).

## things i've done:
### at cmu & elsewhere:
- won the Scott Krulcik Memorial Scholarship for my senior spring.
- spent summer '25 at D.E. Shaw Research working on algorithms for searching trillion-scale chemical libraries. beat literature SoTA in 13 weeks.
- did research in Jia Zhihao's group at CMU on the Mirage compiler. Designed novel method for partitioning operator graphs pre-compilation.
- spent summers '23, '24 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute working on episodic mutagenesis. Published as [Punctuated mutagenesis promotes multi-step evolutionary adaptation in human cancers](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/108058).

## other fun things
I love to read, travel, play soccer & tennis, and try great food. I used to (and still do) love to read science fiction, but a lot of what I read now is contemporary fiction & non-fiction. I also really like art and photography.

My favorite novel is [Orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(novel)), by Samantha Harvey. My favorite piece of non-fiction is [We The Parasites](https://sublunaryeditions.com/products/we-the-parasites) by A.V. Maraccinni. 

If I get to decide on where a trip goes, I always favor Paris and Lisbon. My favorite restaurant in Paris is Cloche Cloche Cloche, my favorite bar there is Danico, and my favorite coffee shop is Seamers.

When I'm in NYC, I like to go to Cervo's (close to the perfect neighborhood restaurant IMO) and Theodora, and get drinks at Manhatta or Bar Rêve.
