I'm a senior studying Computer Science & History at Carnegie Mellon. My interests are in parallel algorithms, ML (systems), and drug discovery. I enjoy thinking about how to solve hard problems with both classical and ML methods.

## things i'm doing:
- will be joining SHV as a Codepoint fellow. Planning to work on ML research at various startups.
- currently head TA of 15-210 at CMU (fall '24-present).

## things i've done:
### at cmu & elsewhere:
- won the Scott Krulcik Memorial Scholarship for my senior spring.
- spent summer '25 at D.E. Shaw Research working on algorithms for searching trillion-scale chemical libraries.
- did research in Jia Zhihao's group at CMU on the Mirage compiler.
- spent summers '23, '24 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute working on episodic mutagenesis.

## other fun things
I love to read, travel, play soccer & tennis, and try great food. I used to (and still do) love to read science fiction, but a lot of what I read now is contemporary fiction & non-fiction. 

My favorite novel is [Orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(novel)), by Samantha Harvey. My favorite piece of non-fiction is [We The Parasites](https://sublunaryeditions.com/products/we-the-parasites) by A.V. Maraccinni. 

My favorite place to travel is Paris, and my favorite restaurant there is Cloche Cloche Cloche.

My favorite places to take people in NYC are Cervo's and Theodora for food and Manhatta for drinks.
